## In S3

- Stores all versions of an object. (including all writes and even if you delete an object)
- Great backup tool.
- Once enabled, **versioning can not be disabled**, only suspended.
- Integrates with **Lifecycle** rules.
- Versioning's **MFA Delete** capability, which uses multi-factor authentication, can be used to provide an additional layer of security.
