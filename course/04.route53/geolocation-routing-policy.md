# GEOLOCATION ROUTING POLICY
## Tips

Geolocation routing lets you choose where your traffic will be sent based on the geographic location of your users. (ie the location from which DNS queries originate)

For example, you might want all queries from Europe to be routed to a fleet of EC2 instances that are specifically configured for European customers. These servers may have the local language of your European customers and all prices are displayed in Euros.
