# DNS 101
## What is DNS?

If you've used the internet, you've used DNS. DNS is used to convert human friendly domain names (such as https://github.com/Nouvellie/) into an Internet Protocol (IP) address (such as http://192.30.253.113/Nouvellie)

IP addresses are used by computers to identify each other on the network. IP addresses commonly come in 2 different forms, IPv4 and IPv6.

#### IPv4:

The IPv4 space is a 32 bit field and has over 4 billion different addresses. (4.294.967.296 to be precise)

#### Ipv6:

Ipv6 was create to solve this depletion issue and has an address space of 128bits which in theory is 340 undecillion addresses. (340.282.366.920.938.463.463.374.607.431.768.211.456)

## Top level domains

If we look at common domain names such as google.com, bbc.co.uk, github.com/Nouvellie, etc. You will notice a string of characters separated by dots. (periods)

The last word in a domain name represents the "top level domain". The second word in a domain name is known as a second level domain name. (this is optional though and depends on the domain name)

| Domains |
| --- |
| .com |
| .edu |
| .gov |
| .co.cl |
| .gov.cl | |

These top level domain names are controlled by the internet assigned number authority (IANA) in a root zone database which is essentially a database of all available top level domains. You can view this database by visiting: http://iana.org/domains/root/db
