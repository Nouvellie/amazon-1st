# ELASTICACHE
## What is ElastiCache?

ElastiCache is a web service that makes it easy to deploy, operate, and scale an in-memory cache in the cloud. The service improves the performance of web applications by allowing you to retrieve information from fast, managed, in-memory caches, instead of relying entirely on slower disk-based databases.

ElastiCache supports two open-source in-memory caching engines:

- Memcached.
- Redis.

## Tips

- Use ElastiCache to increase database and web application performance.
- Redis is Multi-AZ.
- You can do back ups and restores of Reddis.
- If you need to scale horizontally, use Memcached.
